## 📱 **About the App**

Welcome to **PetShop**! 🎉 If you love pets as much as I do (and let’s be honest, who doesn’t?), you’re in the right place. This app is your one-stop-shop for everything furry, feathery, or scaly. Whether you’re looking to spoil your dog with a new toy, treat your cat to some gourmet snacks, or upgrade your fish's aquarium decor, **PetShop** has got you covered! 🐕🐈🐠

I made shopping for your pet as easy as taking a nap on a sunny day. Just add your favorite items to your cart, and let your pet dream of their new goodies. 🛒

### ✨ **Key Features**

- 🛍️ **Easy Shopping**: Browse a wide range of pet products without the stress of catching a runaway cat (because we all know that’s impossible).
- 🐱 **Pet Categories**: Whether it’s for cats, birds, hamsters, or your exotic fish, I’ve got everything covered (yes, even your cat who thinks they own the place).
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart**: Add items to your cart faster than a cat running away when it hears the vacuum start.
- 👤 **User Profile**: Keep your account as tidy as your cat’s “I’m definitely not going to let you move me” nap spot.
